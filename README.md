# Abdullah Siraj 🌌

Hey there! I'm a Computer Science student at SZABIST, obsessed with DevOps, cloud wizardry, and automation. I live for building CI/CD pipelines, optimizing AWS deployments, and scripting solutions that make systems hum. My projects have slashed deployment times by 70% and cut costs by 90%, and I'm ready to bring that energy to innovative teams crafting the future of tech.

## About Me 🚀

## Featured Projects 🛠️

- **[Serverless URL Shortener](https://github.com/Abdullah021Siraj/url-shortener-AWSLamda)**  
  Engineered a serverless microservice with AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB, crushing 2,000+ RPM with <300ms latency. Slashed costs by 90%—proof that serverless is the future!

- **[Weather Dashboard](https://github.com/Abdullah021Siraj/weather-app)**  
  Built a slick Next.js dashboard with TypeScript, hosted on AWS EC2 with PM2. GitHub Actions powers zero-downtime auto-deploys, keeping the UI fresh and responsive.

- **[CI/CD Workflow](https://github.com/Abdullah021Siraj/nextwork-devops)**  
  Designed an AWS CodeBuild-to-CodePipeline CI/CD setup for a Java web app, cutting deployment time by 70%. Bash scripts automated the grunt work, letting me focus on the big picture.

- **[DevOps Portfolio](https://github.com/Abdullah021Siraj/nextjs-devops-portfolio)**  
  Showcased my skills with a Next.js portfolio, containerized via multi-stage Docker builds. GitHub Actions deploys to GHCR, with AWS EC2 hosting and a 70% smaller image size.
